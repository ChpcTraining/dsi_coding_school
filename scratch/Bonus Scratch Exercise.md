# The cat and mouse game
Use your computational thinking skills to develop your own game like the cat and mouse game described below:

A cat chasing a mouse and trying to capture it. The game involves constant pursuit, near captures, and repeated escapes. The cat cannot secure a definitive victory over the mouse, who, despite not being able to defeat the cat, can avoid capture. 

## Step 1
Use the Cat sprite and add code for the Cat sprite to continue moving until the mouse pointer is reached.

## Step 2
Add a time to the Cat sprite.

## Step 3 
Make an empty sprite with two costumes: one blank (costume 1) and one with a "Win" banner (costume 2).
Add code for this sprite to make a variable timer. 

## Step 4
Add the mouse sprite and code for the mouse sprite. For the main cat sprite, change the "touching" and "point" to "Mouse" instead of "Mouse-Pointer".
