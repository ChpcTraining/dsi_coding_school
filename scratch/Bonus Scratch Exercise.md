# The cat and mouse game

## Objective:
The goal is to create a simple game in Scratch where the player controls a mouse using the arrow keys, while the cat automatically chases the mouse. The game ends when the cat catches the mouse. Use your computational thinking skills to develop your own game like the cat and mouse game described above.

## Task:
Create a Scratch project where the cat chases the mouse.
Objective: Use the arrow keys to move the mouse around the screen while the cat automatically chases it.
Instructions:
* Add two sprites: a cat and a mouse.
* Program the mouse to move with the arrow keys.
* Make the cat follow the mouse using the point towards block.
* Detect if the cat catches the mouse, and make the cat say "Got you!" when it does.


Bonus Challenges:
* Add a timer to see how long the mouse can avoid being caught.
* Make the game reset after the cat catches the mouse.
*Add more obstacles or a maze for the mouse to escape through.

The game involves constant pursuit, near captures, and repeated escapes. The cat cannot secure a definitive victory over the mouse, who, despite not being able to defeat the cat, can avoid capture. 

## Step 1
Setup the Sprites:

Q1: Add two sprites to your project: a Cat and a Mouse. What steps do you take to add sprites to your Scratch project?

## Step 2
Movement for the Mouse: 

Q2: Program the mouse to move when the arrow keys are pressed. Can you write a script to make the mouse move up, down, left, and right using the arrow keys?

## Step 3 
Chasing Behavior for the Cat:

Q3: Make the cat continuously chase the mouse. What block will you use to make the cat always point towards the mouse and move towards it?

## Step 4
Catch Detection:

Q4: How can you detect when the cat catches the mouse? What Scratch block can you use to check if the cat touches the mouse?
Hint: Explore the sensing category for a block that detects when one sprite touches another.

## Step 5
Q5: What should happen when the cat catches the mouse? Can you make the cat say "Got you!" and play a sound?
Bonus: Reset the mouse's position when the cat catches it. How can you make the mouse move to a random position when it's caught?
