# Introduction to Scratch 
Scratch is a visual programming language that allows students to create their own interactive stories, games and animations. As students design Scratch projects, they learn to think creatively, reason systematically, and work collaboratively. Scratch was created by the Lifelong Kindergarten group at MIT Media lab and is available for free download at https://scratch.mit.edu/download  Once Scratch is downloaded to a computer, you do not need Internet access to create a project.

## Downloading Scratch
Go to the Scratch website at http://scratch.mit.edu. From the home screen, click on![download_tab](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/95e3307c-74db-4155-8220-7f30204c6d04)

## Starting Scratch

### 1. Click on the scratch icon

To open Scratch, type "scratch" in the search bar and double-click on the Scratch icon. If Scratch is already installed on your computer, check the current version and update it if needed.

### 2. Elements of Scratch

There are four main elements of Scratch: the stage, the sprites, the script and the programming palette. These elements can be compared to a play.

1) *Stage* – similar to the stage in a play. This is where everything will take place. The stage can be different backgrounds (see page 7), just like in a play.
2) *Sprites* – are the actors or main characters of the project. Sprites are programmed to do something in Scratch.
3) *Script* – tells the actors what to say or do. Each sprite is programmed with a script.
4) *Programming palette* – elements used to program the sprite to do or say something. Sprites must be programmed to carry out every function you want them to perform.

## Programming a Sprite - _Control, Motion, Looks and Sound_ 

### Control blocks 

Programming a sprite ALWAYS begins with a control block (orange/yellow category from the programming palette). There are three blocks that can be used to begin programming: ![start script1_resize2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a085b80e-ea59-430c-a6e5-c865ee65d3e9), ![start script2_resize2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e20c2661-352a-4f13-b2f6-58273fd10aa0), ![start script3_resize3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ae872353-0f63-4edd-bbf1-0ffb6fd07b42)


![start script](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b49e50a3-52d7-4179-b668-9a7aa22b1afa)

1) *When the green flag is clicked* – The project will begin when the green flag in the upper right hand corner is clicked.
2) *When space key is pressed* – The project will begin when the space bar is pressed. The black drop down arrow indicates that you can choose a key different from the space bar; and that key will begin the project.
3) *When sprite 1 is clicked* – The project will begin when the sprite is clicked. Note: Click the sprite on the stage, NOT the small thumbnail sprite shown underneath the stage.

Drag the control block to the white scripting area. The next block will connect to this one like a puzzle piece.
