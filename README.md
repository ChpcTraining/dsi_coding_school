# Department of Science and Innovation (DSI) - Centre for High Performance Computing (CHPC) Computer Hardware and Programming Workshop
Insert a brief desciption of what the workshop is about
## Scratch

### Scratch Introduction
**Scratch**
is a visual programming language developed by the MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) Media Lab to teach programming fundamentals through a user-friendly, drag-and-drop interface. It allows users, particularly beginners and children, to create interactive stories, games, and animations by snapping together colourful code blocks. The scratch platform promotes understanding of programming concepts without writing complex code and supports a vibrant community where users can share and remix projects. Scratch is widely used in education to foster computational thinking, creativity, and problem-solving skills.

### Robotics

## Virtual Resources
**Virtual resources** refer to computing components like CPUs, storage, and networks that are abstracted from the physical hardware and are made available in a virtualized environment. These resources enable users to run operating systems, applications, and services without the need for dedicated physical hardware. Virtual resources are typically used in the form of **virtual machines (VMs)** or **cloud computing** services.

#### Why Virtual Resources Are Important:
1. **Scalability**: Virtual resources allow you to easily scale your infrastructure based on demand, whether you're adding more processing power or storage.
2. **Cost-Efficiency**: They reduce the need for expensive physical hardware. Instead, resources are allocated dynamically and efficiently.
3. **Flexibility**: You can quickly deploy different operating systems and applications in isolated environments without affecting the physical hardware.
4. **Resource Optimization**: Virtual resources maximize the use of physical hardware by sharing the infrastructure between multiple virtual instances, improving efficiency.

In the porton of the  workshop, we will cover two key aspects of virtual resources:
- **Virtual Machines on Local Machines**: Understand how to create and manage virtual machines on your local computer, enabling you to simulate different environments or run multiple systems simultaneously.
- **Cloud Resources**: Learn how to deploy and manage resources on the cloud, leveraging scalable and flexible cloud platforms that are provided through the CHPC Sebowa Cloud.

### Linux OS Installation on a Virtual Machine
In this session, participants will be guided through the process of installing Ubuntu on a virtual machine using VirtualBox. The session is focused on setting up a virtualized environment, allowing you to run Ubuntu on your local machine without the need for dedicated hardware. This will provide hands-on experience in creating and managing virtual machines, an essential skill for modern computing environments. It also include the introductaion to a terminbal and using it to run some basic commands.

### Cloud Deployment
