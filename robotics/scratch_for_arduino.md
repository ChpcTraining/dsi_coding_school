# Introduction

Objective: We learnt Scratch and how it works, now we are going to connect it to the real world. We are going to connect it to a microcontroller to control the motors of for our robotics arm project.

# Setup Scratch With Arduino

1. Open up S4A (Scratch for Arduino) in Windows

2. You should see the following:

We will only be working with Motion and Control:

You will notice Motion has different blocks:

You will also see this window on the right, which shows the Arduino board:

However, it says "Arduino1, Searching board...", its trying to connect to your Arduino:

So let us connect it:

You should see some flashing lights on your Arduino board, and now in Scratch you should see:

What is important to see is all those text fields have numbers changing all the time and it says "port: COM10" it may be
a different on you laptop like "port: COM5" or "port: COM3", this just tells us that Scratch is now connected to you Arduino!

Now you should all be quite familiar with Scratch, so now create the following:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fe5c658b-bbfa-471d-a2b0-417f89abc2c5)

Then run it:

You should have seen that on your board, one of the LED lights is flashing on and off.

Modify the "wait" time

# Motor Control

Now let us connect out two servo motors to the Arduino.

Remember the wiring:
