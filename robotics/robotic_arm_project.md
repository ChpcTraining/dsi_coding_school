# Introduction

Now we have learnt enough skills to work on our Robotic Arm Project!

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/df911a56-69f6-41cf-80a9-4dfa7cfcb965)

Objective: Build a robotic arm that can grab a small fluff ball and lift it using your laptop keys. 

Core Components:
1. Programming: Scratch programming to control motors
2. Electronics: Arduino Microcontroller, wiring 
3. Mechanics: Base, Arm, Grabber, Motors


# List of Items

- Arduino
- Male to male jumper wires
- USB cable
- 2x servo motors (gripper and arm)
- ice cream stick (arm)
- tub

To construct everything you will have the following:
- double sided tape of various sizes

# Build the Robotic Gripper:

On your motor you have a section where the wires are coming out. This is the front of your motor. Then there is a white plastic lever at the bottom as shown here:

Take the two plastic eyes in your tub and a small piece of double sided tape and secure it just below where the wires come out.

This will help you remember where the front of the motor is when it turns.

Now, also in your tub you have 3 small parts, A, B, C for the gripper motor, shown here:

You also have 3 blocks of double sided tape squares. 

You have a smaller block of double sided tape square which you should use for the gripper motor.

1. Secure part A to the side of the motor
2. Secure part B to part A
3. Secure part C to the lever on the motor

## Wiring

As mentioned in the previous lesson

Using the male to male jumper wires:

- Connect the 3.3V pin from your Arduino to the red connector on your Gripper motor
- Connect a GND (ground) pin from your Arduino to the brown connector on your Gripper motor
- Connect pin 4 from your Arduino to the orange connector on your Gripper motor

# Build the Robotic Arm:

Planning:

Before constructing your Robotic Arm first get familiar with your items and how best to secure them together: 

- Flip your tub around, it will act as your base for your Robotic arm
- Your Arduino will sit on the bottom of the tub
- Your lifting servo motor should sit on side of the tub base – where is a good spot?
- Your ice cream stick arm needs to be secured to the lifting servo motor – where is a good spot?
- At the end of ice cream stick arm you need to attach your grabber servo motor – where is a good spot?

Using double sided tape:
- Secure your Arduino to the tub:

- Next attach the Arm motor to the base and connect the ice cream stick to the Arm motor:

- Next connect the wires if not already connected.

Using the male to male wires:

- Connect the 5V pin from your Arduino to the red connector on your Arm motor
- Connect a GND (ground) pin from your Arduino to the brown connector on your Arm motor
- Connect pin 8 from your Arduino to the orange connector on your Arm motor

- Attach the the Gripper motor to the end of Arm motor stick:

- Next connect the wires if not already connected:

# Testing the Robotic Arm:

Build a new project using the following Scratch code blocks:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/26ab693b-3bc3-4a03-adbc-54809cb2d0ce)

However, these angles that were chose may not work for you as each Robotic arm is unique!

You need to use trial and error to figure out what are the best angles to do the lifting and grabbing!

Your final goal is to try to lift up the fluff ball

# Reflections

What resources limitations did you have?

What are the limitations of the Robotic Arm, what can and can it not do?

What alternative designs can you recommend or different materials used?

# End of Lesson:

Well done if you have gotten to the end. I hope you have learnt something about robotics!
