# Introduction

Now we have learnt enough skills to work on our Robotic Arm Project!

Objective: Build a robotic arm that can grab a small fluff ball and lift it using your laptop keys. 

Core Components:
1. Programming: Scratch programming to control motors
2. Electronics: Arduino Microcontroller, wiring 
3. Mechanics: Base, Arm, Grabber, Motors


# List of Items

- Arduino
- Male to male jumper wires
- USB cable
- 2x servo motors (gripper and arm)
- ice cream stick (arm)
- tub

To construct everything you will have the following:
- double sided table
- scissors

# Build the Robotic Arm:

Planning:

Before constructing your Robotic Arm first get familiar with your items and how best to secure them together: 

- Flip your tub around, it will act as your base for your Robotic arm
- Your Arduino will sit on the bottom of the tub
- Your lifting servo motor should sit on side of the tub base – where is a good spot?
- Your ice cream stick arm needs to be secured to the lifting servo motor – where is a good spot?
- At the end of ice cream stick arm you need to attach your grabber servo motor – where is a good spot?

Using double sided tape:
- Secure your Arduino to the tub:

- Next attach the Arm motor to the base and connect the ice cream stick to the Arm motor:

- Next connect the wires if not already connected:

- Attach the the Gripper motor to the end of Arm motor stick:

# Testing the Robotic Arm:

Build a new project using the following Scratch code blocks:

Test out your Robotic Arm with the arrow keys in Scratch and try to lift up the fluff ball

# Reflections

What resources limitations did you have?

What are the limitations of the Robotic Arm, what can and can it not do?

What alternative designs can you recommend or different materials used?

# End of Lesson:

Well done if you have gotten to the end. I hope you have learnt something about robotics!
