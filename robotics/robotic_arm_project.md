# Introduction

Now we have learnt enough skills to work on our Robotic Arm Project!

Objective: Build a robotic arm that can grab a small fluff ball and lift it using your laptop keys. 

Core Components:
1. Programming: Scratch programming to control motors
2. Electronics: Arduino Microcontroller, wiring 
3. Mechanics: Base, Arm, Grabber, Motors


# List of Items

- Arduino
- Male to male wires
- USB cable
- 2x servo motors (gripper and arm)
- ice cream stick (arm)
- fluff balls
- sticker eyes
- double sided table
- scissors
- tub

# Method

Planning:

- Flip your tub around, it will act as your base for your Robotic arm
- Your Arduino will sit on the bottom of the tub
- Your lifting servo motor should sit on side of the tub base – where is a good spot?
- Your ice cream stick arm needs to be secured to the lifting servo motor – where is a good spot?
- At the end of ice cream stick arm you need to attach your grabber servo motor – where is good spot?

Using double sided table:
- Flip your tub around, secure your Arduino and lifting servo motor
- Attach the ice cream stick arm to the lifting servo motor 
- Build up the grabber servo motor
- At the end of ice cream stick arm secure your grabber servo motor

Build a new project using the following Scratch code blocks:

Test out your Robotic Arm with the arrow keys in Scratch and try to lift up the fluff ball

# Reflections

What resources limitations did you have?

What are the limitations of the Robotic Arm, what can and can it not do?

What alternative designs can you recommend or different materials used?
